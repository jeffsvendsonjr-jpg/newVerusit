# VerusIT Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 14, 2026**

## Overview

VerusIT is a Chrome extension that adds content freshness badges to Google search results. This privacy policy explains what data VerusIT accesses and how it is handled.

## Data Collection

**VerusIT does not collect, store, transmit, or share any user data.**

Specifically:
- No personal information is collected
- No browsing history is recorded
- No search queries are stored
- No data is sent to any external server
- No analytics or tracking scripts are used
- No cookies are set

## How It Works

VerusIT performs all analysis entirely within your browser:

1. It reads the text content of Google search result snippets on the current page
2. It analyzes date patterns and technology references in those snippets
3. It displays freshness badges directly on the page

All processing happens locally in your browser. No data ever leaves your device.

## Permissions

VerusIT requests only two Chrome permissions:

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to read and modify the current Google search page to add freshness badges. This permission only activates when you are on a Google search page.
- **storage**: Allows the extension to save your preferences (badge visibility, threshold settings) locally using Chrome's built-in storage. This data stays on your device and syncs across your Chrome browsers via your Google account.

## Third-Party Services

VerusIT does not use any third-party services, APIs, or analytics platforms.

## Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be posted here with a new "Last updated" date.
